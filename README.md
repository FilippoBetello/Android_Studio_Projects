# Android Studio Projects
I have been studying app development in Android on my own. As of now I have launched three: 
- Tabata Tomita, for high intensity interval training.
- Judo Quiz, a short game about ten questions with multiple choice about judo.
- DiscoveRome, that is about nightlife but still in development.
 
## :zap:Tabata Tomita
Customizable Tabata timer for your ideal workout !!
- Exercise Time: duration time of each exercise.
- Pause time: pause time between one exercise and another.
- Rest time: rest time between one set of exercises and another.
- Number of repetitions: number of exercises to be done on each repetition.
- Number of sets: number of times you want to repeat the workout.<br>

It starts with a rest time to allow for proper warm-up.<br>

The rules are simple, answer 10 questions correctly to get points. But be careful for each question there is a time limit !! And it is not worth looking on the internet..<br>
